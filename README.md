## Purpose
The purpose of the WeatherWidget is to allow the user to view the weather conditions, temperature, humidity, date, and time without the hassle of pulling out their phone and looking it up. The WeatherWidget can be plugged into a wall or battery supply via USB and placed anywhere convenient for the user to see. It switches between the clock and weather display every 10 seconds and has an LED corresponding to the weather conditions outside for ease of use.
